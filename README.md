Asana Personal Stats
============

This project demonstrates a possible use of the Asana API. It accepts a user's API key and generates various usage graphs for a specific workspace. It is designed to keep track of user productivity trends over time. The original version keeps tracks completed tasks, open tasks, and total followers on a daily basis. Potential future metrics include:

*    Subtasks completed 
*    Average time to complete tasks;
*    Average time to complete subtasks;
*    Percentage of completed tasks vs open tasks;
*    Distinct followers;
*    Number of projects user belongs to
*    Numer of days early / late user completed from due date
